Author using traditional notebook UIs or with a plain text markdown representation of notebooks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto is a multi-language, next generation version of R Markdown from Posit, with many new new features and capabilities. Like R Markdown, Quarto uses knitr to execute R code, and is therefore able to render most existing Rmd files without modification.\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"ggplot2 demo\"\nauthor: \"Norah Jones\"\ndate: \"5/22/2021\"\nformat: \n  html:\n    fig-width: 8\n    fig-height: 4\n    code-fold: true\n---\n\n## Air Quality\n\n@fig-airquality further explores the impact of temperature on ozone level.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-airquality\n#| fig-cap: \"Temperature and ozone level.\"\n#| warning: false\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\")\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombine markdown and Julia code to create dynamic documents that are fully reproducible. Quarto executes Julia code via the IJulia Jupyter kernel, enabling you to author in plain text (as shown below) or render existing Jupyter notebooks.\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Plots Demo\"\nauthor: \"Norah Jones\"\ndate: \"5/22/2021\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-fold: true\njupyter: julia-1.8\n---\n\n## Parametric Plots\n\nPlot function pair (x(u), y(u)). \nSee @fig-parametric for an example.\n\n```{julia}\n#| label: fig-parametric\n#| fig-cap: \"Parametric Plots\"\n\nusing Plots\n\nplot(sin, \n     x-&gt;sin(2x), \n     0, \n     2π, \n     leg=false, \n     fill=(0,:lavender))\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto includes native support for Observable JS, a set of JavaScript enhancements created by Mike Bostock (the author of D3). Observable JS uses a reactive execution model, and is especially well suited for interactive data exploration and analysis.\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"observable plot\"\nauthor: \"Norah Jones\"\nformat: \n  html: \n    code-fold: true\n---\n\n## Seattle Precipitation by Day (2012 to 2016)\n\n```{ojs}\ndata = FileAttachment(\"seattle-weather.csv\")\n  .csv({typed: true})\n  \nPlot.plot({\n  width: 800, height: 500, padding: 0,\n  color: { scheme: \"blues\", type: \"sqrt\"},\n  y: { tickFormat: i =&gt; \"JFMAMJJASOND\"[i] },\n  marks: [\n    Plot.cell(data, Plot.group({fill: \"mean\"}, {\n      x: d =&gt; new Date(d.date).getDate(),\n      y: d =&gt; new Date(d.date).getMonth(),\n      fill: \"precipitation\", \n      inset: 0.5\n    }))\n  ]\n})\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Documents\nGenerate dynamic output using Python, R, Julia, and Observable. Create reproducible documents that can be regenerated when underlying assumptions or data change.\n\nLearn more »\n\n\n\nBeautiful Publications\nPublish high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more. Use a single source document to target multiple formats.\n\nLearn more »\n\n\n\nScientific Markdown\nPandoc markdown has excellent support for LaTeX equations and citations. Quarto adds extensions for cross-references, figure panels, callouts, advanced page layout, and more.\n\nLearn more »\n\n\n\nAuthoring Tools\nUse your favorite tools including VS Code, RStudio, Jupyter Lab, or any text editor.
